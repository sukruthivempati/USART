# Design of Atmel ATMega USART in SystemVerilog
 This design was tested using an UVM testbench.

### Tools Used : 
    Synopsys VCS simulator for simulation and DC (Design Compiler) for synthesis.

### Features of Atmel ATMega USART:
  1. Full duplex Operation
  2. Asynchromous or synchronous operation
  3. Supports serial frames with 5,6,7,8 or 9 data bits and 1 or 2 stop bits
  4. Odd or even parity generation and parity error detection
  5. Framing error detection
