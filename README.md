Design of Atmel ATMega USART in SystemVerilog. This design is tested using an UVM testbench.
Tools Used: Synopsys VCS simulator for simulation and DC (Design Compiler) for synthesis.
Features of Atmel ATMega USART:
  1. Full Duplex Operation
  2. Asynchromous or Synchronous operation
  3. Supports serial frames with 5,6,7,8 or 9 data bits and 1 or 2 stop bits
  4. Odd or even parity generation and parity error detection
  5. Framing error detection
